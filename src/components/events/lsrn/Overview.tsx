                        Life Science Research Night (LSRN) is UROâ€™s largest annual event, held in collaboration with several UBC clubs dedicated to undergraduate students specializing in the life
                        sciences.

                        It brings together researchers, academics, and industry professionals for a series of workshops and panels that highlight the diverse research opportunities at UBC, as well as
                        professional skills associated with a life science career.
