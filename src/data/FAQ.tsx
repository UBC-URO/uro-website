                Yes, and we strongly encourage it! We have Arts mentors with very interesting projects (e.g. linguistics, policy making, climate change, etc.) eager to mentor undergraduate students.

            <p>
                No. Regardless of the extent of an undergraduate student's research experience, we currently only accept mentor applications from graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. If you're
                a senior undergraduate student interested in research, check out our Research Coaches Program or look into presenting at URO's Research Involvement Fair (RIF)!

                No. Unfortunately, mentor applications are closed. If you would like to be added to the mailing list for the 2026–27 cycle of the REX Program, please email{" "}

                <p>
                    REX matching is competitive. There is no guarantee that applying to the REX program will result in a successful match. Matching rates vary each year and there is no reliable
                    estimate for the percentage of mentees who are matched each year.
                </p>
                <p>To maximize your chances, apply to the maximum five (5) mentors.</p>

                    Unmatched REX applications will be given priority access to lab tours and workshops organized by the URO Interdisciplinary Outreach Committee (IOC). Unmatched mentees also retain
                    all general URO membership benefits.

                <p>
                    For a manuscript, you’ll need to adapt your project yourself (mentors aren’t obligated to guide this). Please follow CJUR’s manuscript requirements, and add{" "}

                There will be a spot in the sign-up form to list down the skills you wish your candidates have. We will take these preferences into consideration while screening. However, matches are
                not guaranteed. We kindly ask that you also keep an open mind when meeting with candidates.
